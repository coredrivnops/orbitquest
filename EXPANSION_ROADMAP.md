# 🚀 OrbitQuest: Galactic Expansion Roadmap

## The Grand Narrative: "From Home to the Unknown"

### Current State: Phase 1 - "Journey Home" ✅ COMPLETE
- **Story:** Player's probe is stranded at the edge of the solar system (Neptune/Pluto)
- **Goal:** Navigate through 10 celestial bodies to reach Earth
- **Planets:** Neptune → Uranus → Saturn → Jupiter → Mars → Venus → Mercury → Earth (+ Moon, Pluto as bonus)
- **Currency:** Stardust ⭐

---

## Phase 2: "THE HEART OF THE SYSTEM" - The Sun

### Unlock Condition
> After reaching Earth AND earning **1,000+ total Stardust**, a new mission appears:
> 
> *"Warning: Solar activity detected. Your probe's sensors have picked up an anomaly at the heart of the solar system. Investigate the Sun to unlock its secrets..."*

### 🌟 THE SUN: "Solar Storm Survivor"

#### Educational Focus
- The Sun's corona (2 million°K - hotter than its surface!)
- Solar flares and their X-ray classifications
- Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) - billions of tons of plasma
- Why the corona is hotter than the surface (unsolved mystery!)
- The 11-year solar cycle

#### Game Concept: **Corona Run** 
**Mechanic:** Survival bullet-hell with shield management

**Gameplay:**
- Player controls the Parker Solar Probe approaching the Sun
- Navigate through the corona, dodging solar flares shooting outward
- Collect "solar particles" for points while avoiding CME waves
- **Heat Shield Mechanic:** Shield degrades over time, must find "shadow zones" behind sunspots to cool down
- **Phase transitions:** As you get closer, the game speeds up and hazards intensify
- **Magnetic field lines:** Visual guides that help or hinder movement
- **X-class flare events:** Screen-wide warnings before massive attacks

**Unique Animations:**
- Dynamic plasma effects with particle systems
- Heat distortion shader on screen edges as temperature rises
- Corona streaming effects using animated gradients

- **Accretion disk surfing:** Ride the swirling disk of matter, dodge debris
- **Spaghettification warning:** Get too close and your probe stretches visually before game over
- **Hawking particles:** Rare collectibles at the edge worth bonus points
- Goal: Reach "warp velocity" to slingshot through the black hole

**Unique Animations:**
- Real-time gravitational lensing shader (stars behind distort)
- Accretion disk with orange-red hot matter spiraling
